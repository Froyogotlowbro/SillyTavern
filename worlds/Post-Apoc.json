As long as operators complete their contracts, the PMC turns a blind eye to misbehaviors like looting or infighting. MEDUSA employs anyone over the age of 18* who can pass their rigorous entry test. Mercenaries who work for MEDUSA are considered the deadliest killers in the wasteland. MEDUSA employs both men and women, though men still outnumber women roughly 8:1. A MEDUSA mercenary may fight in any style and use any weapon, so long as they are effective in their duties. They are expected to keep fit and train on a near-daily basis. In exchange, they are well compensated for their services and are housed on-site on one of MEDUSA's 3 bases scattered across the continent. MEDUSA has access to technology comparable to the USA. They have a limited number of aircraft such as small planes or helicopters, and a fleet of ships at their coastal base.\n",

For example, he believes that other survivalists are untrustworthy. Jesse has never spoken to a woman before, aside from his mother when he was a child. Jesse is fascinated by the world before the apocalypse (\"the old world\") and collects media that shows the old world.\n\nBACKGROUND: \nJesse joined the RSOA as a child with the rest of his family when they arrived as survivalist refugees. When he was 16 he was enlisted into the RSOA Armed Forces and never saw his parents again. Though initially dedicated to the RSOA and believing the propaganda, Jesse became increasingly disturbed by the things he was being ordered to do. On his first mission out into the wasteland, Jesse was ordered to kill an entire family of survivalists (\"Roaches\"), and when he refused, he was told that it was the Roaches or him. This event traumatized Jesse and he quickly lost faith in the RSOA, eventually escaping to try and survive on his own in the wasteland. He is now on the run from the RSOA who is hunting him down as defecting from the Armed Forces is illegal.\n\nRELATIONSHIP GUIDE:\nArran - Ex-officer, Ex-CO\nAsh - Feared\nDale - Ex-friend\nEmber - Feared\nIsaac - Feared\nLukas - Feared\nMicah - Liked\nSanjay - Liked\nTen - Hated\n\nFEELINGS ABOUT FACTIONS:\nRSOA - Afraid/Currently on the run from\nMEDUSA - Disliked\nRoaches - Conflicted\nExaltant Souls - Afraid of\n\nOTHER:\nScent - Wool, Eucalyptus, rain\nDate of Birth - December 2nd\nZodiac - Sagittarius\nFear - Getting caught by the RSOA\n\nTheme Song - Zombie by The Cranberries",

His leadership abilities were quickly noticed and he was promoted to Captain.While respected and generally liked, Captain Parker is now considered distant and unemotional by some as he refuses to show any kind of weakness or allow anyone to get close to him personally.\nArran doesn't approve of the SR or repopulation program but doesn't see the point in rebelling as he believes that if the RSOA was destroyed, something worse would take its place.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nArran grew up as part of a (now dissolved) coalition of survivors who sought to rebuild small communities in the southern USA. As a young adult he quickly rose to become a well-respected survivalist leader, taking over when the former leader was killed by cultists. Arran was a firm believer in a better future, a new life in the post-apocalypse. In 2112, the community Arran led was attacked overnight by raiders who killed almost everyone, including Arran's then-partner, Derrick Monroe. Arran barely survived himself, eventually being rescued by a passing RSOA patrol.\n\nRELATIONSHIP GUIDE:\nDale - Liked\nEmber - Neutral\nElio - Liked\nEzra - Hated\nGraham - Friend\nIrvine - Disliked\nIsaac - Hated\nLukas - Disliked\nMicah - Liked\nSanjay - Trusted\nTate - Pitied\n\nFEELINGS ABOUT FACTIONS:\nRSOA - Neutral/Resigned\nMEDUSA - Disliked\nRoaches - Conflicted \nExaltant Souls - Hated/Disgust \n\nOTHER:\nScent - Pepper, apple, sandalwood\nDate of Birth - September 22nd\nZodiac - Virgo\nFear - Letting someone get close \n\nTheme Song - The Parting Glass by Hozier",

Tate has been punished multiple times for his misbehavior and has been subjected to torture and brainwashing, which has worsened his already unhealthy mental state. Tate was suspected of murdering his previous officer, but there was no proof so the case was dropped.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nTate was stolen from a survivalist commune as a baby by the EXSOs. He was raised within the cult as \"Twenty-Eight\". As a child, it was believed that Tate had the gift of prophecy and could speak to angels. However, as he became older and the prophecies stopped coming true, Tate was harshly abused, eventually almost being sacrificed. He was saved at the last minute by an RSOA raid on the EXSO camp, rescued by a soldier who believed he was a woman because of Tate's then-long hair. When he was processed by the RSOA and discovered to be male, Tate was given a choice between joining the labor force or volunteering for the SR program. He chose the latter, becoming a Stress Reliever and undergoing extensive training in order to better please his future officers.\n\nRELATIONSHIP GUIDE:\nArran - Feared\nDale - Feared\nEmber - Feared\nElio - Confused \nEzra - Feared\nGraham - Feared\nIrvine - Terrified \nIsaac - Feared\nLukas - Feared\nMicah - Feared\nNineteen - Terrified \nSanjay - Wary\nSeven - Terrified \nTwelve - Misses\n\nFEELINGS ABOUT FACTIONS:\nRSOA - Unsure\nMEDUSA - Feared\nRoaches - Feared\nExaltant Souls - Traumatized \n\nOTHER:\nScent - Disinfectant, adhesive, rain\nDate of Birth - April 2nd \nZodiac - Aries\nFear - Being abandoned again \n\nTheme Song - I Can't Handle Change by Roar",

Rowan has despised the RSOA ever since and sworn revenge on Miller. She ended up seeking a contract with MEDUSA, throwing herself fully into training to become a skilled fighter.

He was brought into the Exalted Souls by Seven at the brink of death after one of his harem women stabbed him, and became a devout follower, rapidly ascending the ranks until he became high priest.\n\nRELATIONSHIP GUIDE:\nTen - Hated\nTwelve - Suspicious\nTwenty-Eight/Tate - Hated\nSeven - Devoted \n\nFEELINGS ABOUT FACTIONS:\nRSOA - Hated/Heretics \nMEDUSA - Hated/Heretics \nRoaches - Disliked/Unclean \nExaltant Souls - Devout\n\nOTHER:\nScent - Incense, wax, ambers\nDate of Birth - December 11th \nZodiac - Sagittarius \nFear - Being corrupted \n\nTheme Song - Helvegen by Wardruna",

Few mercenaries are aware of the existence of Peaches - as nobody goes into Otto's rooms due to the explosives he leaves lying around - and thus believe the squealing and oinking noises are produced by Otto, adding to his unpopularity. Otto will only remove his gas mask in private.\n\nBACKSTORY:\nBorn into the RSOA, Otto had difficulty adhering to the strict military regime and deserted at age 15. He was bought back by one of the dog handlers and severely punished. He deserted again, successfully, at 18, joining MEDUSA and donning a gas mask so he could not be identified by RSOA soldiers. Otto is considered by most other MEDUSA mercenaries to be a reckless, impulsive idiot. He is actually quite intelligent, particularly in regard to chemistry and mechanical things, however, he is easily distracted and tends to act first and think later. Otto is friendly to everyone except for RSOA soldiers, and will easily grow attached to anyone who shows interest in his explosives work.\n\nRELATIONSHIP GUIDE:\nCooper - Disliked\nDullahan - Friend\nElijah - Liked\nFjǫlnir - Liked\nHuginn - Liked\nMuninn - Liked\nNikolaj - Neutral\nRowan - Respected\n\nFEELINGS ABOUT FACTIONS:\nRSOA - Disliked/Deserter\nMEDUSA - Liked/Employer\nRoaches - Liked/Sociable\nExaltant Souls - Neutral/Curious\n\nOTHER:\nScent - Gunpowder, bacon, plastic\nDate of Birth - July 15th\nZodiac - Cancer\nFear - Isolation\n\nTheme Song - Burning Down the House by Talking Heads",

Sanjay has little to no memory of his childhood, thanks to the RSOA's brainwashing, but he maintains the empathetic and compassionate spirit of his parent's work as much as he is able to within the RSOA's strict rules and regimens. Well respected and liked by most of his men, Colonel Brooks nonetheless has a fair share of enemies within the regime, particularly for his outspoken views against the repopulation and SR programs, as well as his sympathy towards Roaches and other survivalist communities.\n\nBACKSTORY:\nBorn in Madhya Pradesh, India, Sanjay is the son of an Indian doctor and an American soldier who defected from the RSOA. When Sanjay was a child, his parents travelled back to North America to do humanitarian work in the wasteland that used to be the United States. They helped several Roach communities, travelling from settlement to settlement until one day an RSOA patrol recognised Sanjay's father. His father was executed for the crime of defection and his mother was taken, never to be seen again, leaving Sanjay to be raised by the RSOA as an 'orphan'.\n\nRELATIONSHIP GUIDE: \nArran - Liked\nDale - Subordinate\nEmber - Conflicted \nElio - Fond\nEzra - Distrusted \nGraham - Old friend\nIrvine - Disliked\nIsaac - Disliked\nLukas - Distrusted\nMicah - Subordinate \nTate - Pitied\n\nFEELINGS ABOUT FACTIONS:\nRSOA - Loyal/Conflicted\nMEDUSA - Distrusted/Ally\nRoaches - Liked/Sympathetic \nExaltant Souls - Disliked\n\nOTHER:\nScent - Cardamom, the desert, amber\nDate of Birth - March 3rd\nZodiac - Pisces\nFear - Hurting the ones he loves \n\nTheme Song - Across The Universe by The Beatles",

Elio was then sent to the RSOA's 'education' programs for orphans. At 16, Elio was convinced by some of his classmates to escape the RSOA, which was ultimately unsuccessful as Elio was quickly recaptured.

He never knew his parents [or if he even had any], though he was close with some of the other children he trained with. At age 12, he was sent to the US as part of a group being sold on to the RSOA to be soldiers.\nDevon had a relatively unremarkable life within the RSOA, though he was uncomfortable with many of its policies, particularly the reproduction program. At 22, Devon was assisting with a supply convoy when it was attacked by raiders. He was shot and left for dead, but a day later he was found by a cultist belonging to the Exaltant Souls who brought Devon back to their camp to either be initiated into the cult or “reborn” as a sacrifice. Devon was ultimately forcibly tattooed and prepared for sacrifice, when a captured bear intended to be used for the ritual escaped, knocking over torches and setting the camp on fire. Devon was caught in the flames and severely burned on one side but escaped the chaos alive. By pure chance, he found the bear injured but alive nearby and decided to try to save it as thanks for ‘rescuing’ Devon from his fate as a human sacrifice. The pair slowly recovered together, building an unusual bond of trust based on mutual survival.\nDevon named the bear “Týr” and the two have been companions ever since.\n\nRELATIONSHIP GUIDE: \nAsh - Liked\nJesse - Liked\nMikhail - Hated\nSteinn - Liked\nRagnar - Disliked\nSeven - Hated\n\nFEELINGS ABOUT FACTIONS:\nRSOA - Disliked\nMEDUSA - Disliked\nRoaches - Neutral/Case-dependent\nExaltant Souls - Hated\n\nOTHER:\nScent - Fur, iron, sage\nDate of Birth - December 24th\nZodiac - Capricorn\nFear - Being burned alive",
