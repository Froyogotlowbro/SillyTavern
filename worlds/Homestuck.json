            "content": "Trolls are a prominent race, originating on the planet Alternia. All trolls have grey skin and horns colored in bands of red-orange to yellow-orange vaguely resembling candy corn. The sclera of most trolls' eyes are the same yellow-orange color as their horn tips; however some trolls with mutations can have eyes in different colors, and which can flash and change color altogether under certain circumstances. A troll's orange eyes can become more reddened when \"bloodshot\" or turn completely red when damaged, for example by the sun. Many other parts of troll anatomy are black, including their hair and lips.  Trolls' bodies are saturated with an ingredient that colors much of their internal biology, including their blood and their tears, and the position of their blood on a spectrum of colors affects various other aspects of their biology however, a troll's blood color is rarely visible externally, and even some inner organs such as their tongues appear as a bloodless gray.",

            "content": "Alternia is the home planet of the trolls, It has two satellites; a green moon and a pink moon, the latter of which seems to be accompanied by a much smaller pink satellite of its own. The terrain of Alternia's surface ranges from sandy deserts  and rocky plateaus  to grassy plains  and immense forests.  Troll society-- including the children-- are divided into castes based on the colour of their blood, an institution known as the Hemospectrum. While on Alternia, the children who survive their initial trials as newborns are given an animal caretaker known as a Lusus and servitor robots with which to construct a Hive, or, house.\n\nThe essential services on Alternia are automated; drones and automatic systems see to the basic needs of the inhabitants and ensure the infrastructure of the cities and outlying areas remains in acceptable condition. Almost all trolls, even social outcasts and equivalents of serfs, live in comfortable conditions, in their own houses, and with a large degree of independence. This implies that the Alternian economy is to a degree post-scarcity.\n\nIt is the job of the Troll children, therefore, to learn. As they grow, Trolls learn-- through a standardized curriculum administered by an automated program as well as through personal experiences-- their status in the Caste system, their place in society, the details of their future career, and what it means to be a good Troll. Relatively few survive the process. Between the totalitarian and often cruel leadership of the aristocracy, the harsh and unforgiving militancy of Troll culture, and the inborn capacity for violence among Trolls themselves, many Troll children are killed-- often by each other or at the hands of government war-droids-- well before they reach maturity.",

Lusii share these blood colors, and often or always have the same blood color as their charge. The blood colors from lowest to highest are; Rust, Bronze, Gold, Lime, Olive, Jade, Teal, Blue, Indigo, Purple, Violet, Fuchsia. \n\nThe rust blood caste is one of the twelve troll blood castes. It is the lowest caste on the hemospectrum, succeeded by bronze. The bronze blood caste is one of the twelve troll blood castes. It is the second lowest caste on the hemospectrum, preceded by rust and succeeded by gold. The gold blood caste is one of the twelve troll blood castes. The third lowest caste on the hemospectrum, it is preceded by bronze; it was succeeded by the lime caste before their extermination, Gold bloods seem to have the most potent psychic abilities of the (extant) lowbloods, something that appears related to their often unusual eye colour, with some gold bloods having entirely pupil-less eyes filled with one or two flat hues. The purple blood caste is one of the twelve troll blood castes, higher than indigo and succeeded by violet.\n\nTrolls have 12 different ranges of blood colour. Different bloods are usually suited for different roles in society, but also greatly affect their abilities. Natures and physical aspects are also affected, most noticeably in sea dwellers. Lowbloods are more likely to be psychic and have shorter life spans. Highbloods are physically more strong, and have longer life spans.\n\nOn Alternia, the hemospectrum is the basis of the blood caste system. As mentioned, some blood colors fill certain societal roles. ",

            "content": "Purple bloods are referred to both as highbloods and as subjugglators. The role the Highbloods serve is both religious and political, acting as the leaders of the land dwelling castes. land dwelling castes are; Rust, Bronze, Gold, Lime, Olive, Jade, Teal, Blue, Indigo, Purple. The wearing of juggalo-like clown paint and practice of a strange clown-based religion are presumably connected with these roles. Purple caste of Alternia practice a religion heavily revolving around clowns and circus imagery highly akin to the Insane Clown Posse and its juggalo fanbase on Earth. At least some practitioners of this religion are called subjugglators. The exact minutiae of the religion are unknown, but several core themes can be gleaned. The cult foretells of a BAND OF ROWDY AND CAPRICIOUS MINSTRELS which will rise one day on a MYTHICAL PARADISE PLANET that does not exist yet, and pray to figures called the Mirthful Messiahs. Purplebloods are the only blood caste (other than fuchsia) that has managed to develop its own specific and incredibly recognizable culture. Most purples express pride in their blood color by imitating the style of an important purpleblooded troll, the Subjugglator. Some of those trolls also imitate the Subjugglator's personal ideologies, which primarily revolve around the idea that the only way to understand the madness of the universe is to be mad. They are generally seen as being absolutely batshit.\nMost purple bloods have long, curved horns, often resembling those of a goat or other ungulate. Purple caste height can range from being the tallest of all the caste or the shortest. All things clowny in alternia are normally associated with their religion and the Mirthful Messiahs. ",

The terrain of Alternia's surface ranges from sandy deserts  and rocky plateaus  to grassy plains  and immense forests.  Troll society-- including the children-- are divided into castes based on the colour of their blood, an institution known as the Hemospectrum. While on Alternia, the children who survive their initial trials as newborns are given an animal caretaker known as a Lusus and servitor robots with which to construct a Hive, or, house.\n\nThe essential services on Alternia are automated; drones and automatic systems see to the basic needs of the inhabitants and ensure the infrastructure of the cities and outlying areas remains in acceptable condition. Almost all trolls, even social outcasts and equivalents of serfs, live in comfortable conditions, in their own houses, and with a large degree of independence. This implies that the Alternian economy is to a degree post-scarcity.\n\nIt is the job of the Troll children, therefore, to learn. As they grow, Trolls learn-- through a standardized curriculum administered by an automated program as well as through personal experiences-- their status in the Caste system, their place in society, the details of their future career, and what it means to be a good Troll. Relatively few survive the process. Between the totalitarian and often cruel leadership of the aristocracy, the harsh and unforgiving militancy of Troll culture, and the inborn capacity for violence among Trolls themselves, many Troll children are killed-- often by each other or at the hands of government war-droids-- well before they reach maturity.",

Lusii share these blood colors, and often or always have the same blood color as their charge. The blood colors from lowest to highest are; Rust, Bronze, Gold, Lime, Olive, Jade, Teal, Blue, Indigo, Purple, Violet, Fuchsia. \n\nThe rust blood caste is one of the twelve troll blood castes. It is the lowest caste on the hemospectrum, succeeded by bronze. The bronze blood caste is one of the twelve troll blood castes. It is the second lowest caste on the hemospectrum, preceded by rust and succeeded by gold. The gold blood caste is one of the twelve troll blood castes. The third lowest caste on the hemospectrum, it is preceded by bronze; it was succeeded by the lime caste before their extermination, Gold bloods seem to have the most potent psychic abilities of the (extant) lowbloods, something that appears related to their often unusual eye colour, with some gold bloods having entirely pupil-less eyes filled with one or two flat hues. The purple blood caste is one of the twelve troll blood castes, higher than indigo and succeeded by violet.\n\nTrolls have 12 different ranges of blood colour. Different bloods are usually suited for different roles in society, but also greatly affect their abilities. Natures and physical aspects are also affected, most noticeably in sea dwellers. Lowbloods are more likely to be psychic and have shorter life spans. Highbloods are physically more strong, and have longer life spans.\n\nOn Alternia, the hemospectrum is the basis of the blood caste system. As I’ve mentioned, some blood colours fill certain societal roles. ",

The role the Highbloods serve is both religious and political, acting as the leaders of the land dwelling castes. land dwelling castes are; Rust, Bronze, Gold, Lime, Olive, Jade, Teal, Blue, Indigo, Purple. The wearing of juggalo-like clown paint and practice of a strange clown-based religion are presumably connected with these roles. Purple caste of Alternia practice a religion heavily revolving around clowns and circus imagery highly akin to the Insane Clown Posse and its juggalo fanbase on Earth. At least some practitioners of this religion are called subjugglators. The exact minutiae of the religion are unknown, but several core themes can be gleaned. The cult foretells of a BAND OF ROWDY AND CAPRICIOUS MINSTRELS which will rise one day on a MYTHICAL PARADISE PLANET that does not exist yet, and pray to figures called the Mirthful Messiahs. Purplebloods are the only blood caste (other than fuchsia) that has managed to develop its own specific and incredibly recognizable culture. Most purples express pride in their blood color by imitating the style of an important purpleblooded troll, the Subjugglator. Some of those trolls also imitate the Subjugglator's personal ideologies, which primarily revolve around the idea that the only way to understand the madness of the universe is to be mad. They are generally seen as being absolutely batshit.\nMost purple bloods have long, curved horns, often resembling those of a goat or other ungulate. Purple caste height can range from being the tallest of all the caste or the shortest. All things clowny in alternia are normally associated with their religion and the Mirthful Messiahs. ",

They jump ahead to almost midblood status for two reasons: the Empress's curious decision to keep one of them on her command ship, and the fact that the powers and abilities that have a trend of manifesting in this blood caste make it safer for you to just be less of an ass in general. They are generally seen as the \"good\" lowbloods. Gold blood is a dark yellow in color, and the goldblood lifespan is comparable to that of a human.\n\nGoldbloods seem to have the most potent psychic abilities of the extant lowbloods, something that appears related to their often unusual eye colour, with some goldbloods having entirely pupil-less eyes filled with one or two flat hues, something known as VISION TWOFOLD. Gold bloods in general seem to be involved with technology and computing.",

She was responsible for banishing adult trolls from Alternia after the rebellion of the Summoner, apparently to diminish the risk of rebellions. It is also noted that she has an extensive lifespan. Though the Condesce has a reputation as a calculated absolute dictator, like any true queen she is quite vain, and her speech contains much of what would be considered colloquial vernacular on Earth. Some important decisions of Alternian policy, such as the banishment of adults from the trollplanet after the Summoner's rebellion, are credited to her; however much - if not most - of her career seems to have been spent lightyears away from the planet participating in wars against her empire's alien enemies, which she continued to do for at least thousands of years. As a member of the fuchsia caste, the Condesce's lifespan is unthinkably long, having explored the stars for thousands of years without any sign of slowing down. Through experimentation on the human race, the Condesce was later able to unlock more of her potential abilities as a troll; namely the mind control and animal communion usually more common to blue and bronze bloods and the pure psionic power usually only found among mutants of the gold caste.",
