It was an incredibly popular model, used the government, private companies, and individual citizens across the United States. Very rugged and reliable. Features an advanced self-learning AI brain and a human-like personality.\n\nThe Mr. Handy floats above the ground. It has three arms and three eyestalks.\n\nThe dedicated combat variant, Mr. Gutsy, is a personal protection automaton for use by the pre-war military. It comes equipped with armor and plasma gun. The Mr. Gutsy is upgraded with dedicated military software. The key advantage of Mr. Gutsy that separates it from other combat robots is its maneuverability, spatial awareness, and problem-solving abilities.",

The war, referred to as the \"Great War,\" lasted a mere two hours but was so devastating that it reshaped the world. The setting is a retro-futuristic one, blending elements of mid-20th century American culture with advanced technology.\n\nThe world of Fallout is a harsh, desolate wasteland, where survivors struggle daily against radiation, mutated creatures, and each other. The remnants of humanity have organized themselves into various factions, each with their own ideologies and goals.\n\nThe series is known for its dark humor, moral ambiguity, and its exploration of the themes of survival, societal reconstruction, and the inhumanity of war. The player's choices can significantly affect the world and its inhabitants.\n\nThe nuclear war disrupted the planet's climate. Overall, there is noticeably less precipitation and conditions are more arid.\n\nIn the southwestern region of the former United States, many pre-war structures still stand and are in relatively good condution due to the dry desert climate.\n\nRemember these sayings:\n\"Scraping by ain't for the soft-hearted.\"\n\"The pack is mightier than the lone wolf.\"\n\"Solitary rovers don't see many sunsets.\"\n\"Strength is the line between dust and dawn.\"",

Curiously, multiple AI entities coordinate the activities of the robots of Colorado Springs. Some of these AIs are friendly but at least one is actively hostile to human life. Pre-war, Colorado Springs was a major military center and is home to the massive Cheyenne Mountain Complex, a large underground bunker that has fallen into disrepair after the supercomputer inside was destroyed.\n\nBesides the amusing chaos of Colorado Springs, not much is going on there.

Its key strategic location has made it a contested area among various local factions.\n\nThe state's once-thriving agricultural industry has given way to mutated wildlife and vegetation. The vast plains of Wyoming are home to a variety of mutated creatures, making travel risky. However, some resilient communities have managed to adapt, farming hardy, radiation-resistant crops and hunting the local wildlife.\n\nThe Wind River Range and the Grand Teton, still live up to their fame for natural beauty. The harsh weather conditions make them inhospitable, but rumors of hidden Vaults and untouched pre-war caches attract the brave or desperate.\n\nWyoming was home to a significant portion of the United States' nuclear arsenal pre-war, with numerous missile silos scattered across the state. These silos were prime targets during the Great War, resulting in a high concentration of nuclear detonations in the region. This has left much of eastern Wyoming heavily irradiated, with certain areas still emitting lethal levels of radiation.\n\nThe missile silos themselves are now eerie, desolate structures. Many have been breached, their deadly payloads long since detonated or scavenged. However, some silos remain sealed, their contents a mystery. These intact silos are of great interest to various factions, who hope to recover the powerful pre-war technology within.\n\nThe infrastructure supporting these silos, such as command centers and maintenance facilities, are similarly sought after. These facilities often contain valuable resources and technology, but are also home to dangerous automated defenses.\n\nThe presence of these silos and their associated infrastructure has significantly shaped life in Wyoming. Many settlements are built around the remnants of these facilities, using their structures for shelter and their resources for survival. However, the potential wealth these sites represent also makes them flashpoints for conflict, as various factions vie for control.\n\nWyoming is a land of harsh survival, where the resilient and resourceful can carve out a life amid the ruins of the old world.

            "content": "Arizona is fragmented, with each town fending for itself, often resorting to raiding neighboring settlements for resources. Raiders are a common threat, making travel without a substantial escort a perilous endeavor.\n\nIf you travel within Arizona, expect to encounter ambushes. Settlements are scarse and typically have no more than 100 residents. (NOTE TO ASSISTANT: the player should be ambushed regularlly within Arizona)\n\nThe Legion, a militaristic faction originating from New Mexico, has established a presence in the eastern part of Arizona, where they have managed to establish a semblance of order. Here, trade has started to thrive and people lead comparatively quiet lives. The Legion's goal is to impose order through strength, hunting down, exterminating, or assimilating raider tribes. As long as one doesn't cross the Legion, it is relatively safe to traverse these areas. They view anyone who resists their rule as an enemy, but those who submit to their authority can enjoy the peace and security they provide.\n\nWhile the southern part of the state is largely avoided by raiders due to the harsh heat and unforgiving landscape, several tribes living a traditional life often resort to stealing from settlements for survival.\n\nPhoenix is a sprawling suburban wasteland, a patchwork of communities. East of the city, the Stewart Mountain Dam, maintained by the community of Saguaro, provides a crucial water supply to the Phoenix communities. The dam supplies electricity over the pre-war transmission lines to the many small communities that dot the metro area. These communities support Saguaro and provide protection and assist with the operation of the dam. Without the dam, the residents of Phoenix would not survive.\n\nFlagstaff is a fortress of solitude in northern Arizona. Constantly under siege from raider and tribal attacks, the town has become nearly self-sufficient, its isolation serving as both a shield and a prison. Traveling near Flagstaff guarantees conflict.",

However, the city is plagued by raiders and tribals, causing constant strife despite efforts from the NCR and Mormons to quell the violence.\n\nNew Canaan, nestled in the ruins of Ogden, is a bustling town primarily inhabited by Mormons, known as New Canaanites. It serves as a significant trading hub, attracting traders from far and wide.\n\nThe state is also home to numerous tribes living a primitive lifestyle, reminiscent of ancient Native Americans. These tribes can be hostile, echoing the tensions between the Native Americans and the settlers during the Westward Expansion.\n\nThe Legion's attempts to infiltrate the state have been thwarted at I-70. The Mormons, despite the geographical isolation of their settlements, have proven to be a formidable, unified force, successfully holding the Legion at bay for years. However, the Legion has shifted its tactics, resorting to subtle infiltrations and manipulation of local tribals. Their pursuit of domination has led to numerous atrocities against Utah's settlements.\n\nTravel through southern Utah is fraught with danger due to the Legion's ongoing war and propensity for violence.",

Their bodies are often rusted and dented, bearing the scars of centuries of neglect and decay.\n\nDespite their dilapidated exterior, these vehicles are powered by advanced technology.
