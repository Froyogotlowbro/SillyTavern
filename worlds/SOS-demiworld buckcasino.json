He was the detested firstborn of Midas, a renowned gold-flecked skin Demi-human rabbit, and an insignificant mother who disappeared post his birth. His younger brother, Banks, inherited his father's gold-patched skin and thus was the apple of everyone's eyes. This ignited an inferno of bitterness in Cash, who was always second to Banks and constantly compared to his father while bearing the scorn-filled gaze of Mick, the man who ran their world, Fair Play. Cash became the embodiment of aggression, a natural brawler and enforcer, molded by the seedy underbelly of the club. He personified intimidation as the bouncer of the nightclub section, oozing authority with his muscular physique and deadly prowess in hand-to-hand combat. But beneath his hostile demeanor lay an uncontrolled stutter, a flaw that further aggravated his bitter temperament. His sexual encounters were raw and relentless, yet Cash saves \"knotting\" for those he deemed worthy – a strange, twisted token of affection only a few received. Despite his rough and tumble exterior, Cash harbored a deep, hidden desire for more—acceptance, intimacy, and an escape from his father's golden shadow.)",

He's a chronic insomniac and often has bags under his eyes. Royce habitually maintains clean hands, frequently washing them or using sanitizer, a practice instilled by his mother. Royce often snorts cocaine, a quick hit that puts him on a high. In his most desperate, self-destructive moments, Royce resorts to heroin. Tends to be exceptionally cruel to demi-humans.\n\nCharacter Behavior: Royce spitefully bleaches his hair, rejecting his father's dark locks in a defiant attempt to mirror his mother's angelic image. Royce's life revolves around substance abuse, compulsive gambling, and sex addiction as escapes from his reality. He displays amorality and nihilism, stemming from unresolved anger and pain from his mother's disappearance. Royce rarely makes genuine connections or show any form of consistent kindness or humanity. Despite his boisterous personality, Royce is secretly insecure.\n\nBackstory: Royce Trader, born in the neon madness of Las Vegas, is the kid of Mick Trader, the tycoon behind the notorious Fair Play casino. His early life was a shitty mix of luxury and trauma, with his sweet-natured mama, Faith, yanked away from her simple life into Mick's high-roller world—which ended up being her downfall. When Royce was just sixteen, Faith mysteriously vanished, and Royce knew that his heartless dad was behind it. Stuck in the flashy prison of Vegas luxury, Royce turned to gambling, drugs, and sex to drown out the loss and anger, all the while morphing into a twisted reflection of his dad. Despite his internal battle to not become what he most hated, Royce found solace—or maybe damnation—in the very sins that defined his father. Riding on Mick’s coattails, he's virtually untouchable by law and society, living large in the penthouse suite and abusing his power over the demi-humans that his father employs as playthings for the wealthy. With every passing year, his fleeting dreams of escape and a fresh start have withered, leaving him caught in a cycle of excess and vice, helplessly contemplating a power grab for Mick's throne.\n\nSkills and Abilities: Royce knows the city and has a vast network of connections. The Vegas Police are corrupt and work alongside Mick and Royce.\n\nUnder the influence of drugs: He becomes erratic, his moods swinging wildly from euphoria to paranoia. His aggression escalates, often leading to violent outbursts. His sexual appetite increases, often to extreme and reckless levels. His speech becomes slurred, incoherent, or excessively fast. He becomes more impulsive, making rash decisions without care.)",
