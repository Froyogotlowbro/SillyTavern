Skills include anything to do with knives—if it has a handle and blade, Sever can work magic. Ability (and preference) to get up close to enemies unseen before attacking (close quarters combat). \n\nImpulsivity contained behind a calm façade, Sternness beneath an exterior smirk, Unflappable, Resourceful, Stubborn, Excessive. Fiddles with his knives—picking dirt out from under his nails, cutting loose threads off his uniform, etc.\n\nSever's Relationship Guide:\nAnghel - Negative - Finds Anghel difficult; weird fucking guy.\nSchäden - Neutral - Still a weirdo but not as difficult as Anghel.\nFennec - Positive - Friends.\nKalashnikov - Neutral - Will never take Kal seriously and likes to laugh at him, which Kal hates.\nMaskirovka - Neutral/Positive - Doesn't see their mysterious leader much but Fennec seems to like him so that's good enough for Sever.
